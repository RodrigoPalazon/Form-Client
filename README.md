# Form-Client
Clients' information and feedback


In this project I used the new tools from HTML5 as attributes and tags, 
giving more attention to the:

      - Semantic Concept
      - Application of a big amount of different elements as: inpunts,labels,  checkboxes, radiobuttons 
        and textarea.

To the CSS3, I used some concepts of UX (to make the form as readeble as possible), combination of selectors, and a short part of Flexbox.
